**Agent Capability Negotiation and Binding Protocol**

**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel protocol for agent capability negotiation and binding, designed to operate within heterogeneous agentic environments managed by an Agent Name Service (ANS) infrastructure (Huang, Narajala, Habler, Sheriff, 2025). Building upon the root-level capability discovery provided by ANS, this protocol facilitates the negotiation and binding of agent capabilities to specific skills. We define skills as the fundamental units of workload performed by a capability, encompassing API calls, file read operations, SQL queries, and other atomic tasks. The protocol provides a formalized and unambiguous sequence of steps for negotiation and binding, ensuring practical implementation and ease of understanding. The protocol incorporates the `protocolExtension` framework defined in ANS, promoting interoperability across various agent communication protocols.

**1. Introduction**

The increasing complexity of multi-agent systems (MAS) necessitates robust mechanisms for capability discovery, negotiation, and binding. While capability discovery mechanisms such as the Agent Name Service (ANS) (Huang, Narajala, Habler, Sheriff, 2025) provide a means to locate agents with a desired high-level capability (e.g., `DocumentTranslation`, `RiskAssessment`), they do not address the finer-grained details of how that capability is realized. Agents offering the same root-level capability may possess different skill sets, utilize varying protocols (e.g., A2A, MCP, ACP), or exhibit diverse performance characteristics. Therefore, a negotiation and binding protocol is essential to ensure that the selected agent possesses the precise skills required for a given task and that the interaction is conducted in a compatible and efficient manner.

This paper introduces a formal protocol for Agent Capability Negotiation and Binding (ACNBP), designed to be practical, easily implementable, and readily integrated with existing capability discovery mechanisms, specifically the ANS framework. The core innovation of this protocol lies in its ability to navigate the nuanced landscape of skill selection within a high-level capability, while remaining protocol-agnostic by leveraging the `protocolExtension` mechanism defined within ANS. This maintains interoperability without requiring direct knowledge of each agent's underlying communication protocol.

**2. Literature Review**

This section reviews existing approaches to capability negotiation and binding in MAS, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and motivating the need for the protocol presented in this paper. We also examine how existing protocols address the heterogeneity challenge addressed by the ANS and ACNBP framework.

*   **Contract Net Protocol (CNP)**: The Contract Net Protocol [Smith, 1980] is a foundational approach to task allocation and negotiation in distributed systems. It involves a manager agent advertising a task, and potential worker agents bidding on that task based on their capabilities. The manager then selects the most suitable worker based on the bids received. While CNP provides a basic framework for negotiation, it lacks a formal representation of capabilities, fine-grained skill negotiation, and explicit mechanisms for handling protocol diversity.
*   **FIPA Contract Net Interaction Protocol**: The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) specifications [FIPA, 2000] provides a standardized version of the Contract Net Protocol, incorporating concepts of agent communication languages (ACLs) and ontologies. However, similar to the original CNP, FIPA's version doesn't include fine-grained capability descriptions needed for sub-skill negotiation. The focus remains on task-level negotiation, limiting its applicability to scenarios requiring detailed skill-set matching.
*   **Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP)**: GPGP [Decker & Lesser, V.R, 1992] focuses on coordinating distributed problem-solving agents. Agents exchange information about their plans and capabilities to find mutually beneficial collaborations. This approach emphasizes plan coordination but does not necessarily address the specific negotiation and binding of individual skills required for a given task, nor does it tackle protocol differences. The coordination is often based on global objectives rather than specific, granular skill requirements.
*   **Semantic Web Services (SWS)**: Technologies like OWL-S [Martin et al., 2007] and WSMO [Roman et al., 2005] enable semantic descriptions of web services, including their capabilities, inputs, and outputs. While SWS provides a rich framework for describing capabilities, the negotiation and binding aspects are often left to be implemented on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, SWS primarily focuses on web services and may not be directly applicable to the diverse agent communication protocols (e.g., A2A, MCP, ACP) that are emerging. The complexity of SWS can also pose a barrier to practical implementation in resource-constrained environments.
*   **Capability-Based Addressing:** Bradshaw et al. [Bradshaw et al, 1997] proposes capability-based addressing schemes for distributed systems. However, it doesn't focus on the dynamic negotiation of capabilities but more on their static assignment, nor on integrating various agent protocols. This approach is valuable for static environments, but less adaptable to dynamic MAS.
*   **Auction Mechanisms**: Various auction mechanisms [Krishna, 2009] have been applied to task allocation in MAS. While auctions can be effective for resource allocation, they typically involve price-based bidding and do not explicitly address the negotiation and binding of specific skills required to perform a task or how to handle protocol differences.
*   **Agent Communication Languages (ACLs)**: KQML [Finin et al., 1994] and other ACLs provide a standardized vocabulary and syntax for agent communication. However, they do not inherently address the capability negotiation and binding problem or the challenge of interoperating across different protocols. ACLs provide a communication framework, but lack the semantic richness for skill-level negotiation.
*   **Emerging Agent Communication Protocols (A2A, MCP, ACP)**: The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol [Surapaneni et al., 2025], Model Context Protocol (MCP) [Anthropic, 2024; MCP Specification, 2025], and Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) [IBM Research, 2025] represent significant advancements in standardizing agent interactions. However, they primarily focus on communication *after* an agent has been discovered and do not inherently address the initial capability negotiation and binding process, especially in a protocol-agnostic manner. The protocols listed may not be enough for complete agent interoperability
*   **Agent Name Service (ANS)**: Our previous paper (Huang, Narajala, Habler, Sheriff, 2025) details an architecture for secure agent discovery based on verifiable identities and protocol-agnostic naming. This paper builds upon the ANS framework by providing a concrete protocol for negotiating and binding agent capabilities, leveraging the `protocolExtension` mechanism to support diverse communication protocols.

**3. Protocol Design**

This section presents the formal specification of the Agent Capability Negotiation and Binding Protocol (ACNBP). We build upon the ANS naming and discovery framework and incorporate the `protocolExtension` mechanism to maintain interoperability across diverse agent communication protocols. We will also address design to make more practical to implement.

**3.1 Definitions**

*   **Agent:** An autonomous entity capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and acting upon it [Russell & Norvig, 2016]. Each agent is registered in the ANS and has a unique ANS name: `<protocol>://<agentName>.<agentCapability>.<providerName>.v<version>.<extension>`. The agent must possess an A2A, ACP, or MCP or other protocols, so negotiation can happen. We denote the set of agents in the system as `A = {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}`.
*   **Capability (C):** A high-level function or service that an agent can provide (e.g., `DocumentTranslation`, `RiskAssessment`). We denote the set of capabilities as `C = {c_1, c_2, ..., c_m}`. The ANS discovery mechanism provides means to discover capabilities and we treat high-level skills here.
*   **Skill (S):** A basic unit of workload performed by a capability. A skill can be an API call, a file read operation, a SQL query, or any other atomic task. We denote the set of skills as `S = {s_1, s_2, ..., s_k}`. A capability can be realized by a combination of these basic skills. Note that skill is defined at protocol level in ANS architecture.
*   **Skill Set (SS):** A set of skills required to perform a specific task or sub-task. `SS ⊆ S`. The specific skills included in a skill set are protocol-dependent and may be advertised within the `protocolExtension` field of the ANS record.
*   **Capability Realization (CR):** A mapping from a capability to a specific skill set. `CR: C → P(S)`, where `P(S)` is the power set of S. Different agents may realize the same capability with different skill sets, and this realization is often protocol-specific.
*   **Negotiation Context (NC):** A set of parameters and constraints that influence the negotiation process, such as Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, *capability consistency check*, security policies, and cost limitations. `NC = {p_1, p_2, ..., p_r}`. The negotiation should include the price of different skills as well.
*   **protocolExtension (PE):** A JSON object containing protocol-specific data, as defined in the ANS framework. This allows agents using different communication protocols to exchange relevant information without requiring the core ACNBP protocol to understand each protocol's intricacies. A protocol extension could also include some standard data set, so interoperability can happen. It also includes the high-level skills used by protocol.
*   **Binding (B):** An agreement between two agents (a requester and a provider) to execute a specific skill set for a given capability, under a specific negotiation context, and using a specific communication protocol (specified in the provider's ANS name). `B = (a_req, a_prov, c, ss, nc, pe)`, where `a_req` is the requester agent, `a_prov` is the provider agent, `c` is the capability, `ss` is the skill set, `nc` is the negotiation context, and `pe` is the `protocolExtension`.

**3.2 Protocol Steps**

The ACNBP protocol consists of the following steps:

1.  **Capability Discovery (CD):** A requester agent (`a_req`) uses the ANS to locate provider agents (`A_prov`) that offer the desired capability (`c`).

    ```
    A_prov = ANS_Lookup(a_req, c)
    ```

    The ANS lookup returns a list of ANS names for agents offering the desired capability. The requester agent can then resolve these names to obtain the agents' contact information and `protocolExtension` data. All agents in this list need to be part of a communication protocol

2.  **Skill Set Request (SSR):** The requester agent sends a skill set request message to each provider agent in `A_prov`, specifying the required negotiation context (`nc`) and including its own `protocolExtension` (if needed). For easier implementation, the protocol extension should follow some set of OpenAPI, so implementation is easier.

    ```
    a_req → a_prov : SSR(c, nc, pe_req)  for all a_prov ∈ A_prov
    ```

3.  **Skill Set Offer (SSO):** Each provider agent (`a_prov`) evaluates the skill set request, considering its own capabilities and protocol-specific requirements (encoded in its `protocolExtension`), and responds with a skill set offer message, specifying the skill set (`ss`) that it can provide, along with associated costs, QoS parameters, and its own `protocolExtension` (`pe_prov`). The exact structure of the `ss` is protocol-dependent and is described within the `pe_prov`. The protocol extensions are standardized for better interoperability.

    ```
    a_prov → a_req : SSO(c, ss, costs, qos, pe_prov)
    ```

4.  **Skill Set Evaluation (SSE):** The requester agent evaluates the skill set offers received from the provider agents, considering the negotiation context (`nc`), its own `protocolExtension` (`pe_req`), and the provider's `protocolExtension` (`pe_prov`). This evaluation may involve cost-benefit analysis, QoS comparisons, compatibility checks between the protocols, and *a check to ensure the provider agent has not altered its advertised capabilities since the initial discovery*.

    ```
    Scores = {Evaluate(SSO_i, nc, pe_req, pe_prov) for SSO_i ∈ {SSO received from A_prov}}
    ```

5.  **Skill Set Selection (SSS):** Based on the evaluation, the requester agent selects the most suitable provider agent (`a_prov_selected`) and sends a skill set selection message. Since some agents may not reply, therefore agent must account for the time it takes to send. If the agents selected is failed, it is recommended another selection needs to happen.

    ```
    a_prov_selected = Select(A_prov, Scores)
    a_req → a_prov_selected : SSS(c, ss, nc, pe_req)
    ```

6.  **Binding Confirmation (BC):** The selected provider agent confirms the binding by sending a binding confirmation message to the requester agent. To improve the security, authentication should be established at this stage. A final check should be performed here
    ```
    a_prov_selected → a_req : BC(c, ss, nc, pe_prov)
    ```

7.  **Execution (E):** The requester agent and the provider agent proceed with the execution of the agreed-upon skill set, according to the binding agreement. The specific details of the execution are protocol-dependent and are governed by the contents of the `protocolExtension` fields. Before execution, the agents needs to verify the identity with the private key.

8.  **Commit or Abort:** After the agent has finished, it either has success or an error. For auditability reason, the logs are needed to be committed. It is best to follow ACID model to support the integrity of data.
    *   If the execution is completed successfully, then commit the change with all logs and records
    *   If the execution has an error, then abort, notify, and rollback.

**3.3 Capability Consistency Check**

To address the risk of an agent changing its capabilities after the initial ANS lookup, but before the execution, a capability consistency check is implemented. There are several possible approaches:

1.  **Timestamped ANS Records:** Each agent record in the ANS is timestamped. The Requester Agent stores the timestamp of the initial ANS lookup. Before sending the Skill Set Selection (SSS) message, the Requester Agent re-queries the ANS for the selected Provider Agent's record. If the timestamp in the record has changed, it indicates that the provider agent's capabilities may have been altered.

    *   *Pros:* Relatively simple to implement, leverages existing ANS infrastructure.
    *   *Cons:* Doesn't guarantee that the *specific* skills negotiated are still valid (only checks if the *overall* record has changed).

2.  **Signed Capability Statements:** The provider agent's SSO message includes a digitally signed statement of its current capabilities (including the specific skills being offered). The Requester Agent verifies this signature against the agent's public key obtained from the ANS.

    *   *Pros:* Provides a more granular check of the specific skills being offered.
    *   *Cons:* Requires the provider agent to generate and sign a capability statement for each offer, adding computational overhead.

3.  **ANS Capability Commitment:** The act of responding to a skill set request could be interpreted as a *commitment* by the provider agent to maintain the advertised capabilities for a reasonable period of time. The Requester Agent could hold the provider accountable (e.g., via a reputation system) if it later discovers that the provider's capabilities have changed.

    *   *Pros:* Doesn't require any additional communication or computation.
    *   *Cons:* Relies on a reputation system, which may not be fully reliable or effective.

4.  **Pre-Execution Check**: The requester can request the skills during the BC before the agent performs any task.

Which ever one are selected, the agent can be hold accountible by its reputation score or other method by another paper.
**3.4 Formalization with Mathematical Notation**

Let's dive deeper into formalization.

*   **Set of Agents**: As declared before, let \( A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\} \) be the set of all agents in the system.

*   **Capabilities and Skills**:
    *   Let \( C = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_m\} \) be the set of all high-level capabilities.
    *   Let \( S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_k\} \) be the set of all atomic skills.

*   **Relations**:
    *   \( R \subseteq C \times 2^S \) is a relation indicating how capabilities are realized using skills, i.e., \( (c, skills) \in R \) means that capability \( c \) can be achieved with the set of skills \( skills \), where \( skills \subseteq S \). Note: This is high level relationship
*   **Context**:
    *   Let \( P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_r\} \) be the set of possible contextual parameters.
    *   Context \( ctx \subseteq P \) is a particular situation with a subset of these parameters.

*   **protocolExtension Data**:
    *   Let \( PE \) be the set of all possible `protocolExtension` data structures.
    *   Should follow standard model such as openAPI.

*   **Messages**:
    1.  **Skill Set Request (SSR)**: An agent requests a set of skills for a capability:
        ```
        SSR(a_{sender}, a_{receiver}, c, ctx, pe_{sender})
        ```
    2.  **Skill Set Offer (SSO)**: An agent offers a set of skills to achieve a capability:
        ```
        SSO(a_{sender}, a_{receiver}, c, skills, costs, qos, pe_{sender})
        ```
    3.  **Skill Set Selection (SSS)**: An agent selects a specific set of skills for a capability:
        ```
        SSS(a_{sender}, a_{receiver}, c, skills, ctx, pe_{sender})
        ```
    4.  **Binding Confirmation (BC)**: An agent confirms the binding:
        ```
        BC(a_{sender}, a_{receiver}, c, skills, ctx, pe_{sender})
        ```

*   **Functions**:
    1.  **ANS Lookup**:
        ```
        ANS_Lookup(a, c) \rightarrow \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_j\}
        ```
        This returns a set of agent ANS names that claim to provide capability \( c \). The actual protocol details are stored in ANS protocol extension part for that agent. The protocol must be A2A, ACP, MCP or other
    2.  **Evaluate SSO**:
        ```
        Evaluate(SSO, ctx, pe_{requester}, pe_{provider}, CapabilityCheck) \rightarrow score
        ```
        This function evaluates a skill set offer given the context, the requester's protocol extension, the provider's protocol extension, the result of Capability Check, and returns a score.
    3.  **Select**:
        ```
        Select(agents, scores) \rightarrow agent^*
        ```
        Chooses the best agent based on scores, which is the end result of Evalute.

*   **Axioms and Constraints**:
    1.  **Valid Offers**: The skills offered must be a valid realization of the capability:
        ```
        \forall SSO(a_{sender}, a_{receiver}, c, skills, costs, qos, pe_{sender}): (c, skills) \in R
        ```
    2.  **Context Compatibility**: Selected skills must be compatible with the context:
        ```
        \forall SSS(a_{sender}, a_{receiver}, c, skills, ctx, pe_{sender}): Compatible(skills, ctx, pe_{sender})
        ```
    3.  **Protocol Compatibility**: Ensure that all agents is compatible with a protocol, so can ensure it is compatible with protocol.
        ```
        \forall bc(a_{sender}, a_{receiver}, c, skills, ctx, pe_{sender}): is_A2A|| is_MCP || is_ACP
        ```
    4.  **Capability Consistence**: The capability offerred must be the original and never has it altered.
    \forall SSS(a_{sender}, a_{receiver}, c, skills, ctx, pe_{sender}): isCapabilityAltered==false

This formalized section offers a rigorous representation of the negotiation and binding process, integrating the `protocolExtension` concept from the ANS framework.

**4. Sequence Diagram**

To improve understanding, let's present the sequence diagram here.

*Agent Requester (AR) looks up through ANS to find Agent Provider (AP). AR discover the protocol information.
*AR sends Skill Set Request (SSR) with capability, context, and requester's protocolExtension.
*AP sends Skill Set Offer (SSO) with capabilities, costs, QoS, and provider's protocolExtension.
*AR performs Capability Consistency Check.
*AR evaluates the SSO, considering both protocolExtensions and the capability check.
*AR sends Skill Set Select (SSS)
*AP sends Binding Confirmation (BC)

**5. Concrete Example**

To illustrate the ACNBP protocol in action, let's consider a document translation scenario involving agents using A2A and MCP protocols.

*   **Capability:** `DocumentTranslation`
*   **Skills:** This level of details can be found in protocolExtensions
*   **Agents:**
    *   `TranslatorA`: Offers `DocumentTranslation`, is compliant with A2A protocol. Its `protocolExtension` includes an A2A Agent Card with details about its supported language pairs, pricing, and security policies.
    *   `TranslatorB`: Offers `DocumentTranslation`, is MCP compliant. Its `protocolExtension` includes an MCP Tool description outlining its supported translation services, QoS guarantees, and API endpoint.
*   **Negotiation Context:**
    *   `QoS`: Requester requires high accuracy and low latency.
    *   `Cost`: Requester has a limited budget.
    *   `Security`: Document contains sensitive information and requires secure translation. Protocol needs to be HIPAA compliant
*   **Requester Agent**: The agent can only support A2A and MCP

**Protocol Execution:**

1.  The requester agent (`a_req`) uses ANS to locate `DocumentTranslation` providers and receives the ANS names of `TranslatorA` and `TranslatorB`. It also resolves these names to obtain their contact information and `protocolExtension` data, storing the timestamp of the ANS record.
2.  `a_req` sends a skill set request to both `TranslatorA` and `TranslatorB`, specifying the QoS, cost, and security requirements. The request also includes `a_req`'s protocolExtension data, indicating its support for both A2A and MCP.
3.  `TranslatorA` responds with a skill set offer. Its `protocolExtension` (A2A Agent Card) specifies its supported language pairs, pricing ($0.10 per page), estimated latency (1 second per page), and security policies (HIPAA compliance).
4.  `TranslatorB` responds with a skill set offer. Its `protocolExtension` (MCP Tool description) specifies its supported translation services, QoS guarantees (99.9% uptime), API endpoint. Does not support HIPAA.
5.  `a_req` re-queries the ANS for `TranslatorA`'s record and verifies that the timestamp has not changed. In this case, imagine something changed the terms.
6.  `a_req` evaluates the offers based on the negotiation context, considering the information in the `protocolExtension` fields.

**6. Security Considerations**

The ACNBP protocol introduces specific security considerations that must be addressed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of agent interactions. These considerations build upon the security foundations provided by the ANS framework (PKI, certificate management) and extend to the negotiation and binding process.

*   **Data Integrity and Authenticity:**
    *   *Threat:* Malicious agents could tamper with skill set offers or binding confirmation messages, leading to incorrect or compromised configurations.
    *   *Mitigation:* All ACNBP messages (SSR, SSO, SSS, BC) must be digitally signed using the agent's private key, as managed by the ANS PKI infrastructure. This ensures message integrity and allows the recipient to verify the sender's identity. Implement the certificate revocation in real time to minimize man in the middle attack.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:**
    *   *Threat:* An attacker could flood the system with a large number of skill set requests, overwhelming provider agents and disrupting the negotiation process.
    *   *Mitigation:* Implement rate limiting on incoming skill set requests to prevent individual agents from overwhelming the system. Employ CAPTCHAs or other challenge-response mechanisms to distinguish legitimate agents from bots. Leverage distributed architectures to distribute the load across multiple servers. Use byzantine algorithm and fault tolerance.
*   **Replay Attacks:**
    *   *Threat:* An attacker could capture and replay valid ACNBP messages, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or resource consumption.
    *   *Mitigation:* Include timestamps and nonces (unique identifiers) in all ACNBP messages to prevent replay attacks. Validate the timestamp against a reasonable time window and ensure that the nonce has not been previously seen. Consider using sequence numbers to track the order of messages.
*   **Protocol Extension Vulnerabilities:**
    *   *Threat:* Malicious agents could exploit vulnerabilities in the `protocolExtension` data structures to inject malicious code or compromise other agents.
    *   *Mitigation:* Strictly validate all data within the `protocolExtension` fields against well-defined schemas or ontologies. Sanitize any user-provided input to prevent code injection or cross-site scripting attacks. Implement sandboxing or other isolation mechanisms to limit the impact of exploited protocol extensions.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   *Threat:* Sensitive information, such as skill requirements or cost data, could be exposed during the negotiation process.
    *   *Mitigation:* Encrypt all ACNBP messages using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or other secure transport protocols. Consider using attribute-based encryption to selectively reveal information only to authorized agents. Minimize the amount of sensitive data transmitted during the negotiation process.
*   **Trust in ANS Infrastructure:**
    *   *Threat:* The ACNBP protocol relies on the trustworthiness of the underlying ANS infrastructure. If the ANS is compromised, malicious agents could impersonate legitimate agents or manipulate the capability discovery process.
    *   *Mitigation:* Ensure that the ANS infrastructure is properly secured, following best practices for PKI management, access control, and intrusion detection. Regularly audit the ANS infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Consider using a distributed or federated ANS architecture to increase resilience and reduce the risk of a single point of failure.
*   **Compromised Agents:**
        *Threat:* A legitimate agent is under control of malicious user. Then it will impersonate other agents.
        *Mitigation:* Ensure proper key storage. If find compromised, immediately revoke the certificate.
*   **Capabilty Changining over time**:
      *Threat:* Capabilty Chaning After ANS and before execute. A malicous changed it key and use this time to get it in.
      *Mitigation:* Follow methods such as ANS sign, reputation, time stamp to track and account.

By addressing these security considerations, the ACNBP protocol can provide a robust and trustworthy mechanism for capability negotiation and binding in heterogeneous agentic environments.

**7. Discussion**

The ACNBP protocol offers several potential benefits, particularly when integrated with the ANS framework:

*   **Fine-Grained Capability Selection:** Enables requesters to select provider agents based on specific skill sets, considering protocol-specific information encoded in the `protocolExtension` fields.
*   **Protocol Agnosticism:** Supports interoperability across diverse agent communication protocols by leveraging the `protocolExtension` mechanism, minimizing the need for core protocol logic to understand each protocol's intricacies.
*   **Adaptability and Flexibility:** Allows for dynamic negotiation of capabilities, adapting to changing requirements, resource constraints, and protocol capabilities.
*   **Formal Precision:** The formalized specification ensures that the protocol is unambiguous and can be implemented consistently across different platforms and environments.
*   **Integration with ANS:** Seamlessly integrates with the ANS framework for agent discovery, identity verification, and lifecycle management.
*    The proposed method can prevent capabilty changes by various methods.

However, the ACNBP protocol also has some limitations:

*   **Complexity:** The negotiation process can be complex, especially in scenarios with a large number of agents and skills. The evaluation function needs to incorporate compatibility logic of different protocols.
*   **Communication Overhead:** The exchange of skill set request and offer messages can incur significant communication overhead, especially in resource-constrained environments.
*   **Reliance on ANS:** The protocol depends on the existence and proper functioning of an ANS infrastructure.
*   **protocolExtension Complexity:** The design assumes that a wide variety of capabilities is supported by protocolExtension.
*   Potential of DOS attacks Due to many requests and workload needs to be performed.
*   Limited Number of Protocols to pick.

**8. Future Work**

Future work will focus on addressing the limitations of the ACNBP protocol and extending its functionality. Specific areas of investigation include:

*   **Optimizing the Negotiation Process:** Exploring techniques for reducing the complexity and communication overhead of the negotiation process, such as using heuristics or machine learning to prioritize agents and skills.
*   **Standardizing `protocolExtension` Data Structures:** Developing standardized data structures and ontologies for encoding common capabilities and skills within the `protocolExtension` fields, promoting greater interoperability. A common structure is the agent can handle the interoperability.
*   **Supporting Dynamic Skill Discovery:** Developing mechanisms for agents to dynamically discover new skills and update their capability descriptions.
*   **Experimentation and Evaluation:** Conducting experiments to evaluate the performance and scalability of the ACNBP protocol in realistic multi-agent environments.
*   **Security and Trust:** Implement the best security with the system for side channel, sybil attack, and man in the middle attack
*   **Experiment on the proposed Capabilty ConsistenceCheck and evaluate its benefits, pros and cons,

**9. Conclusion**

This paper has presented a novel protocol for agent capability negotiation and binding, designed to operate within heterogeneous agentic environments managed by an ANS infrastructure. The ACNBP protocol facilitates the negotiation and binding of agent capabilities to specific skills, leveraging the `protocolExtension` mechanism to support diverse communication protocols. The formalized specification and concrete example demonstrate the applicability and potential benefits of the protocol. Future work will focus on addressing the limitations of the protocol and extending its functionality, paving the way for more robust and efficient multi-agent systems.
